#Here are instructions to create your first ansible playbook
#You need 3 VMs, preferably created with PowerShell or Terraform or ARM. 
#I created mine in the portal and I'll work on getting that scripted tomorrow

#Once the VMs are created using centOS this time, we'll install ansible on the master node

#for Ubuntu
sudo apt update
sudo apt install ansible

#For centOS you have to add the epel-release repo first then install ansible
sudo yum install epel-release
sudo yum install ansible

#next we use ssh keys to make life easier for everyone, especially ansible itself
#first generate keypairs
cd ~
ssh-keygen

#then copy the generated keys to the remote nodes
ssh-copy-id -i id_rsa.pub 192.168.25.5
ssh-copy-id -i id_rsa.pub 192.168.25.6

#to keep things organised I put all my files in a file called ansiblefiles in my home directory
mkdir ansiblefiles

#Create an ansible inventory file
cd ~
cd /ansible
touch inventory.hosts

#The inventory file can look something like this. there are about 400 ways to write this file so don't be married to any style

node1 ansible_host=192.168.25.5 ansuble_user=jxmmi
node2 ansible_host=192.168.25.6 ansible_user=jxmmi
node7 ansible_host=192.168.25.7 ansuble_user=jxmmi
node8 ansible_host=192.168.25.8 ansible_user=jxmmi

[stage]
node1
node2

[prod]
node7
node8

# Test connectivity to all my hosts
ansible all -i ansiblefiles/inventory.hosts -m ping

#Now we want to create an ansible playbook to run a shell script that installs terraform on our target machines 
#this would be super valuable if we had a large number of target servers and don't want to have to configure them one after the other

nano installtfubuntu.sh

#contents of the file**************************

#!/bin/bash

sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install -y gnupg software-properties-common

wget -O- https://apt.releases.hashicorp.com/gpg | \
gpg --dearmor | \
sudo tee /usr/share/keyrings/hashicorp-archive-keyring.gpg

echo "deb [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/hashicorp-archive-keyring.gpg] \

sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/hashicorp.list

sudo apt update

sudo apt-get install terraform

#*******************file ends here

#next we change the permissions of the file to make it executable
chmod +x installtfubuntu.sh

#now that we have a good running script, we can push the config to the other nodes using a terraform playbook

nano main.yaml

#file contents are the actual yaml script for ansible

- name: 'Playbook to Install Terraform on Target Nodes'
  hosts: stage
  become: yes
  tasks:
    - name: Copy terraform install script to remote server
      copy:
        src: installtfubuntu.sh
        dest: /tmp/install_terraform.sh
        owner: jxmmi
        group: jxmmi
        mode: ugo+x

    - name: Run a shell command
      shell: /tmp/install_terraform.sh


#***********file ends here

#then we run the yaml file using 

ansible-playbook -i inventory.hosts main.yaml -v

#that does the job. Congratulations you have your first yaml file
